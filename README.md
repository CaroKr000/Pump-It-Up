# Pump-It-Up: 
### Machine Learning Project in Python 

This challenge is hosted by *DrivenData*, a platform that hosts data science competitions in areas related to social impact and international development. The data for this competition comes from the Taarifa waterpoints dashboard, which aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water. 

The target variable consists of three classes of water pumps: **Functional**, the ones that **require repair** work, and **non-functional**. This is a classic classification problem of how to accurately predict the operating condition.

| Label | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Functional | The waterpoint is operational and there are no repairs needed |
| Functional - needs repair | The waterpoint is operational, but needs repairs |
| Non functional | The waterpoint is not operational |

An understanding of the respective conditions of these waterpoints can triage maintenance repairs and save the Ministry both time and money.
