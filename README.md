# Pump-It-Up
Machine Leaning Project in Python


In this assignment we are going to help the Tanzanian Ministry of Water in providing water to their people. In particular we are going to participate in the Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table challenge 
(https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/). 

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, our task is to predict the operating condition (which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all) of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset.
